glob_paths
==========

.. py:method:: barecat.Index.glob_paths(pattern, recursive = False, include_hidden = False, only_files = False)

   Glob for paths matching a pattern.

   The glob syntax is equivalent to Python's :py:func:`glob.glob`.

   :param pattern: Glob pattern.
   :param recursive: Whether to glob recursively. If True, the pattern can contain the ``'/**/'``
                     sequence to match any number of directories.
   :param include_hidden: Whether to include hidden files and directories (those starting with a
                          dot).
   :param only_files: Whether to glob only files and not directories.

   :returns: A list of paths.
