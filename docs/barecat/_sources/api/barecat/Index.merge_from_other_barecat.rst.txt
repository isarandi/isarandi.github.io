merge_from_other_barecat
========================

.. py:method:: barecat.Index.merge_from_other_barecat(source_index_path, ignore_duplicates = False)

   Adds the files and directories from another Barecat index to this one.

   Typically used during symlink-based merging. That is, the shards in the source Barecat
   are assumed to be simply be placed next to each other, instead of being merged with the
   existing shards in this index.
   For merging the shards themselves, more complex logic is needed, and that method is
   in the Barecat class.

   :param source_index_path: Path to the source Barecat index.
   :param ignore_duplicates: Whether to ignore duplicate files and directories.

   :raises sqlite3.DatabaseError: If an error occurs during the operation.
