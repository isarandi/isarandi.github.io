.. py:method:: barecat.FileSection.seek(offset, whence=0)

   Change stream position.

   Change the stream position to the given byte offset. The offset is
   interpreted relative to the position indicated by whence.  Values
   for whence are:

   * 0 -- start of stream (the default); offset should be zero or positive
   * 1 -- current stream position; offset may be negative
   * 2 -- end of stream; offset is usually negative

   Return the new absolute position.
