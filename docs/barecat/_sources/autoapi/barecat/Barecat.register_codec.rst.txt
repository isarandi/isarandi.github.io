==============

.. py:method:: barecat.Barecat.register_codec(exts, encoder, decoder, nonfinal = False)

   Register an encoder and decoder for a file extension.

   This allows automatic encoding and decoding of files based on their extension, used in
   the dictionary interface, e.g., ``__getitem__``, ``__setitem__`` and ``items`` methods.

   :param exts: List of file extensions to register the codec for.
   :param encoder: Function to encode data into bytes.
   :param decoder: Function to decode bytes into data.
   :param nonfinal: If True, other codecs are allowed to be applied afterwards in a nested                 manner. This is useful for, e.g., compression codecs.
