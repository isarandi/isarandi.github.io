==================

.. py:method:: barecat.Barecat.remove_recursively(item)

   Remove (delete) a directory and all its contents recursively from the archive.

   Technically, file contents are not erased from the shard file at this point, only the
   corresponding rows in the index database are removed.

   :param item: Either a BarecatDirInfo object, or a path to a directory within the archive.

   :raises FileNotFoundBarecatError: If a directory with this path does not exist in the archive.
