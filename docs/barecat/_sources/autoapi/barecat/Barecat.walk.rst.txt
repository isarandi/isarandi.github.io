.. py:method:: barecat.Barecat.walk(path)

   Recursively list all files and directories in the tree starting from a directory.

   This is analogous to Python's ``os.walk``.

   :param path: Path to the directory within the archive.

   :returns: Iterator over (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) tuples, where ``dirpath`` is the path to
             the directory, ``dirnames`` is a list of all subdirectory names, and ``filenames`` is
             a list of all filenames in the directory.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> bc = Barecat('test.barecat', readonly=False)
   >>> bc['dir/file.txt'] = b'Hello, world!'
   >>> bc['dir/subdir/file2.txt'] = b'Hello, world2!'
   >>> for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in bc.walk('dir'):
   ...     print(dirpath, dirnames, filenames)
   dir ['subdir'] ['file.txt']
   dir/subdir [] ['file2.txt']
