========

.. py:method:: barecat.FileSection.readline(size = -1)

   Read and return a line from the stream.

   If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.

   The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text
   files, the newlines argument to open can be used to select the line
   terminator(s) recognized.
