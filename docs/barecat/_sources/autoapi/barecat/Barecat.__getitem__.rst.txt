.. py:method:: barecat.Barecat.__getitem__(path)

   Get the contents of a file in the Barecat archive.

   :param path: Path to the file within the archive.

   :returns: The contents of the file. Either raw bytes, or decoded based on the file extension, if
             ``auto_codec`` was True in the constructor, or
             if codecs have been registered for the file extension via ``register_codec``.

   :raises KeyError: If a file with this path does not exist in the archive.
