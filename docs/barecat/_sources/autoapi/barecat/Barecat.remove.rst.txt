.. py:method:: barecat.Barecat.remove(item)

   Remove (delete) a file from the archive.

   Technically, the data is not erased from the shard file at this point, only the
   corresponding row in the index database is removed.
   An exception is when the file is the last file in the shard, in which case the shard file
   is truncated to the end of the file.

   :param item: Either a BarecatFileInfo object, or a path to a file within the archive.

   :raises FileNotFoundBarecatError: If a file with this path does not exist in the archive.
   :raises IsADirectoryBarecatError: If the path refers to a directory, not a file.
