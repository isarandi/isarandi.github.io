   Compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) between the input masks.

   This is typically used with two input masks, but more are also supported.

   :param masks: a list of RLE masks

   :returns:

             A scalar IoU value, expressing the ratio of the intersection area to the union area of
                 the masks.
