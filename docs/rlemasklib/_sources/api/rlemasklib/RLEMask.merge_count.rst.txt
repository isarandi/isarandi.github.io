merge_count
===========

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.merge_count(masks, threshold)
   :staticmethod:


   Return a mask where each pixel is set if and only if at least `threshold` of the
   input masks have that pixel set.

   For example, if ``threshold`` is set as half the number of masks, then the result will
   be the majority vote of the masks.

   :param masks: a list of RLEMask objects
   :param threshold: the threshold for merging

   :returns: A new RLEMask object representing the merged mask.
