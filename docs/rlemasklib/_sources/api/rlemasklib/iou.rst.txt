.. py:function:: rlemasklib.iou(masks)

   Compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) between the input masks.

   IoU as the ratio between the overall intersection and the overall union.

   :param masks: a list of RLE masks

   :returns:

             A scalar IoU value, expressing the ratio of the intersection area to the union area of
                 the masks.
