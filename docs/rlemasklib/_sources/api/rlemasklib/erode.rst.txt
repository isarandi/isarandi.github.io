.. py:function:: rlemasklib.erode(rle, connectivity = 4)

   Erode a mask with a 3x3 kernel.

   After erosion, only those pixels remain foreground that were foreground before and all its
       neighbors (according to the specified connectivity, 4-way or 8-way) are also foreground.

   :param rle: an RLE mask dictionary
   :param connectivity: either 4 or 8, the connectivity of the erosion. 4 means a cross-shaped
                        kernel, 8 means a square kernel.

   :returns: An RLE mask dictionary of the eroded mask.
