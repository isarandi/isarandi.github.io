is_valid_rle
============

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.is_valid_rle()

   Check if the RLE mask is valid (no nonfirst zero runs and runs summing to H*W).

   The RLE mask is valid if it has no zero sized runs except perhaps in the first place,
   and the sum of the runs is equal to the number of pixels in the mask, as determined
   by the shape (height, width) of the mask.
