.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.from_counts(counts, shape, order='F', validate_sum = True)
   :staticmethod:


   Create an RLEMask object from run-length counts.

   :param counts: the run-length counts of the mask, as a list of integers or a numpy array,
                  where odd-indexed elements are runs of 0s and even-indexed elements are runs of 1s.
                  The sum of the counts must be equal to height * width.
   :param shape: [height, width] of the mask
   :param order: the order of the counts in the list, either 'F' or 'C' for Fortran
                 (column major) or C (row major) order
