merge_many_custom
=================

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.merge_many_custom(masks, func)
   :staticmethod:


   Merge many masks using a custom n-ary boolean function.

   This first calls func with all combinations of n boolean arguments and stores the resulting
   truth table.
   It then returns a new mask where the ith pixel is the result of func applied to the ith
   pixel of all input masks.

   :param masks: a sequence of at RLE masks
   :param func: a callable that takes n bools and returns a bool

   :returns: A new RLEMask with the merged result.

   .. seealso::

      :meth:`merge_many`, which allows merging with binary Boolean functions.
      :meth:`make_merge_function`, which creates a merge function from a custom n-ary function.
