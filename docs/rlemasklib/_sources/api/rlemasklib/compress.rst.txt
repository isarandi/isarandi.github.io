.. py:function:: rlemasklib.compress(rle, zlevel = None)

   Compress an RLE mask to a compressed RLE.

   Note that the input needs to be an RLE, not a decoded binary mask.

   :param rle: a mask in RLE format
   :param zlevel: optional zlib compression level, None means no zlib compression, -1 is zlib's
                  default compression level and 0-9 are zlib's compression levels where 9 is maximum
                  compression.

   :returns: A compressed RLE mask.
