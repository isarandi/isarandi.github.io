.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.resize(output_imshape, fx = None, fy = None)

   Resize the mask to a new shape.

   It is enough to provide either the `output_imshape` or the scaling factors `fx` and `fy`.

   Internally this is implemented as an affine transformation.

   :param output_imshape: the shape of the output image as (height, width)
   :param fx: the scaling factor along the horizontal axis
   :param fy: the scaling factor along the vertical axis

   :returns: A new RLEMask object representing the resized mask.
