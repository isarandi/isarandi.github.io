========

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.erode3x3(connectivity = 4, inplace = False)

   Erode a mask with a 3x3 kernel.

   After erosion, only those pixels remain foreground that were foreground before and all its
   neighbors (according to the specified connectivity, 4-way or 8-way) are also foreground.


   :param connectivity: either 4 or 8, the connectivity of the erosion. 4 means a cross-shaped
                        kernel, 8 means a square kernel.
   :param inplace: whether to perform the operation in place or to return a new object

   :returns: The RLEMask object representing the eroded mask (self if inplace=True)
