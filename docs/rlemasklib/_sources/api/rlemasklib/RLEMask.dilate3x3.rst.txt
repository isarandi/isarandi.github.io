=========

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.dilate3x3(connectivity = 4, inplace = False)

   Dilate a mask with a 3x3 kernel.

   After dilation, all pixels that were foreground before remain foreground and additionally any
   pixel with at least one foreground neighbor (according to the specified connectivity, 4-way or
   8-way) becomes also foreground.

   :param connectivity: either 4 or 8, the connectivity of the dilation. 4 means a cross-shaped
                        kernel, 8 means a square kernel.
   :param inplace: whether to perform the operation in place or to return a new object

   :returns: The RLEMask object representing the dilated mask (self if inplace=True)
