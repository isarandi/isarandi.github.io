.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.connected_components(connectivity = 4, min_size = 1)

   Extract connected components from the mask.

   :param connectivity: 4 or 8, the connectivity of the components. If 4, then only horizontal
                        and vertical connections are considered, if 8, then also diagonal connections are
                        considered.
