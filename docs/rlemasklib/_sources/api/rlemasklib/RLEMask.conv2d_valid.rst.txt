conv2d_valid
============

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.conv2d_valid(kernel, stride = (1, 1), threshold = 0.5)

   Perform a 2D convolution with the given weighted kernel and threshold the result.

   This function does not perform any padding and only returns the "valid" part of the
   convolution, similar to "valid" padding mode in deep learning frameworks as opposed to
   "same" or "full" padding.

   :param kernel: the convolution kernel as a 2D numpy array
   :param stride: the stride of the convolution as two integers
   :param threshold: the result is set to 1 if the convolution result is greater than this value

   :returns: A new RLEMask object representing the convolved and thresholded mask.
