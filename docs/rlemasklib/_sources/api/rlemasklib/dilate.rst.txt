.. py:function:: rlemasklib.dilate(rle, connectivity = 4)

   Dilate a mask with a 3x3 kernel.

   After dilation, all pixels that were foreground before remain foreground and additionally any
   pixel with at least one foreground neighbor (according to the specified connectivity, 4-way or
   8-way) becomes also foreground.

   :param rle: an RLE mask dictionary
   :param connectivity: either 4 or 8, the connectivity of the dilation. 4 means a cross-shaped
                        kernel, 8 means a square kernel.

   :returns: An RLE mask dictionary of the dilated mask.
