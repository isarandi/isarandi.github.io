avg_pool2d_valid
================

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.avg_pool2d_valid(kernel_size, stride = (1, 1), threshold = -1)

   Perform a 2D average pooling with the given kernel size and threshold the result.

   This function does not perform any padding and only returns the "valid" part of the
   pooling, similar to "valid" padding mode in deep learning frameworks as opposed to
   "same" or "full" padding.

   :param kernel_size: the size of the pooling kernel as two integers
   :param stride: the stride of the pooling as two integers
   :param threshold: the result is set to 1 if the pooled result is greater than this value

   :returns: A new RLEMask object representing the pooled and thresholded mask.
