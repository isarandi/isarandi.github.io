.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.from_array(mask_array, thresh128 = False, is_sparse = True)
   :staticmethod:


   Create an RLEMask object from a dense mask.

   By default, any nonzero value is considered foreground and zero is considered background.
   If ``thresh128`` is set to True, then values greater than or equal to 128 are considered
   foreground and less than 128 are considered background.

   If `mask_array` is C contiguous, a transpose has to take place since the internal RLE
   format encodes the mask in Fortran order. If `is_sparse` is set to True, the transpose,
   if necessary, will be performed in RLE format, otherwise it will be performed in dense
   array format.

   :param mask_array: a numpy array of numerical type where nonzero means foreground and zero
                      means background.
   :param thresh128: whether to use 128 as the threshold for binarization (default is 1)
   :param is_sparse: hint that it is more efficient to transpose the mask in RLE form, only
                     affects efficiency when the mask is C contiguous.
