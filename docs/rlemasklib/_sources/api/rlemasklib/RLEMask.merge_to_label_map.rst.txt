merge_to_label_map
==================

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.merge_to_label_map(rles)
   :staticmethod:


   Merge a list of RLE masks to a label map indicating which masks contains each pixel.

   That is, the output is an integer-valued numpy array containg for each pixel the (index+1)
   of the mask that has the pixel set, or 0 if no mask has the pixel set.

   If multiple masks have the pixel set, the index of the last among the input masks will
   be used in the output.
