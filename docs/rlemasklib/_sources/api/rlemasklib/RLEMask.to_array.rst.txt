.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.to_array(value = 1, order='F')

   Convert the RLE mask to a dense 2D uint8 numpy array.

   False (background) values become 0 and True (foreground) values become the specified value.
   The RLE is internally stored for the Fortran order, so order='F' is faster, because
   'C' requires a transpose. To improve efficiency, the transpose is done either in RLE or
   in dense form, depending on the sparseness of the mask.

   :param value: the "True" value to use in the resulting array
   :param order: the order of the array ('C' for row-major, 'F' for column-major)

   :returns: An F or C-contiguous 2D numpy array of type uint8 representing the mask.
