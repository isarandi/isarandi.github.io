===========

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.__getitem__(key)

   Crop the RLE mask to get a submask, by slicing, or retrieve a single pixel value.

   :param key: a slice, a tuple of two slices or two ints (one for height and one for width)

   :returns: A new RLEMask object representing the submask.

   :raises ValueError: if the key is not a tuple of two slices or two integers.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   With slices:

   >>> rle = RLEMask(np.eye(4))
   >>> rle[1:3, 2:4].shape
   (2, 2)

   With integers:

   >>> rle = RLEMask(np.eye(4))
   >>> rle[1, 1]
   1
