.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.repeat(num_h, num_w, inplace = False)

   Repeat the mask pixels multiple times along the axes, analogous to np.repeat (and not like np.tile).

   This repeats each pixel in the mask `num_h` times along the vertical axis and `num_w` times
   along the horizontal axis.

   :param num_h: the number of times to repeat the mask along the vertical axis
   :param num_w: the number of times to repeat the mask along the horizontal axis
   :param inplace: whether to perform the operation in place or to return a new object

   :returns: An RLEMask object representing the repeated mask (self if inplace=True)
