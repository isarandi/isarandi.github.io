largest_interior_rectangle_around
=================================

.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.largest_interior_rectangle_around(center_point, aspect_ratio = None)

   The largest axis-aligned foreground rectangle with a given center point.

   Without `aspect_ratio`, the rectangle will have odd height and odd width and have
   the pixel at position `center_point` as its central pixel.
   When aspect_ratio is given, the rectangle may have non-integer dimensions.

   If the output is `r`, the following will hold:

   - ``center_point[0] == r[0] + (r[2]-1) / 2``
   - ``center_point[1] == r[1] + (r[3]-1) / 2``
   - ``r[2] / r[3] == aspect_ratio``
   - the region defined by ``r`` is entirely inside the foreground

   :param center_point: the (x,y) center pixel coordinates of the rectangle
   :param aspect_ratio: the desired aspect ratio of the rectangle (width/height)

   :returns: An array (x, y, width, height) of the top-left corner and dimensions of the rectangle.

   .. seealso:: :meth:`largest_interior_rectangle` for the largest rectangle without specifying the center point.
