.. py:method:: rlemasklib.RLEMask.merge_many(masks, func)
   :staticmethod:


   Merge many masks using either the same or different Boolean functions.

   This is a reduce operation from the left, as:

   merge(merge(masks[0], masks[1], func[0]), masks[2], func[1]), ...

   If only one function is provided, it is applied in all steps.

   :param masks: a sequence of RLE masks
   :param func: a single Boolean function or a sequence of Boolean functions

   :returns: A new RLEMask with the merged result.

   .. seealso:: :meth:`merge_many_custom`, which allows merging with custom n-ary Boolean functions.
